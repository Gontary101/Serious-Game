## 1. COMPLETE GAME RULES

### 1.1 Game Overview

**Theme & Objective**  
*Eco-Factory Challenge* is a *serious* and *educational* board game in which players assume the role of industrial entrepreneurs committed to building sustainable industries. Your core challenge is to develop efficient factory networks and manage resources responsibly while minimizing environmental impact. The **victory condition** is determined by the best *capital-to-pollution ratio* at the end of the game, emphasizing the delicate balance between economic growth and environmental stewardship.

**Core Mechanics**  
1. **Terrain Acquisition & Development**: Each player must strategically purchase terrain with varying resource potential and build factories optimized for that terrain.  
2. **Resource Extraction & Processing**: Players extract resources, process them in factories, and sell finished goods in a shared market, driven by *supply and demand* dynamics.  
3. **Technology Research & Implementation**: Innovations can significantly improve efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate pollution, but come at investment and maintenance costs.  
4. **Worker Management**: Players recruit, train, and assign specialized workers to operate factories at maximum efficiency and further reduce pollution.  
5. **Pollution & Carbon Tax**: All industrial activity generates pollution, which incurs taxes and potential penalties. Excessive pollution can cripple a player’s economy.  
6. **Economy & Strategy**: The game employs no random elements. Success hinges on how skillfully players plan and adapt their strategies, leveraging technology, terrain, and workforce.

### 1.2 Game Setup

**1.2.1 Board Layout & Terrain Types**  
- The standard board for 4 players can be arranged as a **5×5** or **6×6** grid of terrain tiles (total of 25 or 36 tiles).  
- Each terrain tile is marked with a *Terrain Type*: for instance, **Plains**, **Forest**, **Mountain**, **Coastal**, **Urban**, or **Wetlands**. Each type offers unique resources and challenges.  
- Each Terrain Type has a *Base Purchase Cost* and *Maintenance Implications*:  
  - **Plains**: Medium cost; suitable for agriculture-related factories.  
  - **Forest**: Medium-high cost; good for wood-based industries but can also help offset carbon emissions if preserved or reforested.  
  - **Mountain**: High cost; rich mineral deposits for mining, potentially higher environmental risks.  
  - **Coastal**: Medium-high cost; fishing potential or ocean-based carbon-capture tech.  
  - **Urban**: High cost; ideal for large-scale manufacturing, but pollution is more heavily taxed.  
  - **Wetlands**: Lower cost; limited building potential, but can be used for water treatment or specialized eco-services.

**1.2.2 Starting Resources**  
Each player begins with:  
- **Capital**: 2000 Eco-Credits (EC).  
- **No factories** (players must build their first factory).  
- **No workers** (players must hire from the worker pool).  
- **No technologies** (players must acquire or research tech cards).  
- **Zero pollution** on their record.

**1.2.3 Step-by-Step Setup**

1. **Shuffle & Lay Out Terrain Tiles**  
   - Arrange the chosen terrain tiles face-up in a 5×5 or 6×6 grid. The arrangement is visible to all players, so they can plan accordingly. No random draws are needed; the arrangement is a fixed board for consistent strategy.
2. **Initial Terrain Purchase**  
   - In turn order (decided by mutual agreement or an external non-luck method, e.g., alphabetical order of players’ names), each player selects **one** terrain tile to purchase at its *Base Purchase Cost*.  
   - This process continues in a *snake draft* (player 1, 2, 3, 4, then 4, 3, 2, 1, and so on) until each player has purchased **2 terrain tiles**.  
   - All players now place their markers on those tiles to denote ownership.
3. **Initial Factory Construction (Optional)**  
   - Players may (but are not required to) build **one** factory on each of their terrain tiles, paying the *Construction Cost* of that factory.  
   - If they choose not to construct a factory during setup, they can build it later.
4. **Worker Allocation (Optional)**  
   - At the start, players may hire up to **2 workers** total (of any type, if available) by paying their *Salary* costs. Additional workers can be hired later.
5. **Draw or Select Technology Cards**  
   - At the beginning of the game, each player **may** purchase **one Technology Card** from the available face-up technology row (optional). Payment for that technology is made immediately in *Initial Cost (EC)*.  
   - If no player chooses a technology now, the tech cards remain available for purchase during the game.

After these steps, each player’s initial setup is complete. The game begins.

### 1.4 Detailed Rules

#### 1.4.1 Terrain Purchase & Development

- **Purchasing Terrain**:  
  - Each terrain has a *Base Purchase Cost* (e.g., Plains 200 EC, Forest 250 EC, Mountain 300 EC, Coastal 250 EC, Urban 350 EC, Wetlands 150 EC).  
  - Once purchased, the player pays an annual *Terrain Maintenance Cost* (e.g., 10% of the terrain’s purchase cost per round). This can be modified by technologies (e.g., reforestation reduces carbon tax, advanced logistics reduces shipping costs, etc.).  
  - Terrain can be *developed* by building factories or infrastructure. Some technologies (like afforestation) may *block* a terrain tile from industrial use but provide carbon offsets.

- **Selling or Exchanging Terrain**:  
  - If players wish to sell terrain to another player, they must mutually agree on a price. Payment is immediate, and the terrain plus its structures transfers ownership.  
  - The game includes no random event or forced buyback mechanism; all trades are entirely at players’ discretion.

#### 1.4.2 Factory Construction, Operation, and Upgrades

- **Factory Construction**:  
  - Each factory card has a *Construction Cost (EC)* and a *Space Requirement* (number of terrain tiles or fraction thereof).  
  - Each terrain tile can host only a single factory unless specific *modular expansions* or *vertical factories* technology is utilized.

- **Operation & Upkeep**:  
  - Each factory has an *Operational Cost (EC)* to run per round, covering utilities, maintenance, and overhead.  
  - Factories require specific **Input Resources** to function at full capacity (e.g., metals, biomass, water, energy).  
  - Output is the **Finished Products** or *Services* that can be sold or used in other factories.

- **Upgrades**:  
  - Factories may be upgraded with *improvements* (technology modules or expansions) that enhance production, reduce pollution, or unlock new product lines.  
  - Costs for upgrades are listed under each factory card or technology card.  
  - Upgraded factories typically require advanced worker types or specialized training.

#### 1.4.3 Resource Extraction, Processing & Management

- **Resource Nodes**: Certain terrain tiles yield resources (e.g., Mountains for minerals, Forest for timber). Extraction requires an appropriate factory (e.g., a Logging Facility on Forest tiles).
- **Processing**: Factories transform raw resources into intermediate or finished products. Additional processing chains can yield more valuable products but often increase pollution or energy demands.
- **Resource Depletion**: Each tile has a *Resource Capacity* (agreed upon at the start). When fully extracted, that tile can no longer produce. This can trigger end-game if multiple resources run out.

#### 1.4.4 Product Manufacturing, Transportation, and Sales

- **Manufacturing**: Once raw inputs are available, factories can produce goods according to their *Production Rate*. Skilled workers and certain technologies can boost this rate.
- **Transportation**: Players must move goods from the factory to the marketplace or to another factory.  
  - **Electric Transport** is cleaner but may have higher initial costs.  
  - **Fossil Fuel Transport** is cheaper initially but incurs pollution taxes.
- **Sales & Pricing**: In the *basic* version, players set product prices, and all goods are considered sold at a universal market. In *advanced* versions, supply and demand can be tracked to adjust prices each turn.

#### 1.4.5 Technology Research, Acquisition, and Implementation

- **Technology Cards** provide *specific improvements* (see the complete list in Section 2).  
- Each technology has an *Initial Cost (EC)* and an ongoing *Maintenance Cost (EC)*.  
- **Prerequisites** may exist (e.g., advanced pollution-control tech might require basic pollution-control first).  
- Technologies can impact multiple factories and also reduce or increase certain cost factors.

#### 1.4.6 Worker Recruitment, Training, Management, and Specialization

- **Worker Cards** define roles like Engineers, Technicians, Environmental Scientists, etc. (see Section 4).  
- Each worker has a *Salary (EC)* per round. Specialized training can improve that worker’s impact on production or pollution.  
- Factories have a *Minimum Worker Requirement* to run at full capacity. Understaffing reduces output; overstaffing is possible but costly.

#### 1.4.7 Pollution, Carbon Tax, and Environmental Regulations

- **Pollution Types**: For simplicity, track one aggregated *Pollution Score*, though advanced rules can differentiate between air, water, and soil pollution.  
- **Carbon Tax**: Each turn, players pay a tax based on their total *Pollution Score*. A typical formula could be **Tax = 5 EC × (Pollution Score)**, subject to modifications by certain policies or technologies.  
- **Environmental Regulations**: If a player’s pollution exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50 points), they might face additional fines or mandatory cleanup technology adoption.  
- **Mitigation**: Reforestation, carbon-capture modules, and advanced waste treatment can reduce *Pollution Score* or offset emissions.

#### 1.4.8 Player Interaction

- **Trading**: Players may freely trade resources, products, technology licenses, or worker contracts by mutual agreement.  
- **Cooperation**: Players can form alliances to coordinate resource usage, reduce combined pollution, or share technology costs.  
- **Competition**: Players can attempt to *outbid* each other for valuable terrain, or undercut each other in the marketplace.

#### 1.4.9 End-Game Conditions & Victory Calculation

- **End-Game Trigger**: The game ends immediately after one of the following:  
  1. All resource tiles are depleted.  
  2. No unowned terrain tiles remain (the board is fully purchased).  
  3. All players agree to end early if expansions are no longer viable.  

- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Calculate each player’s total **Capital** (EC) on hand.  
  - Calculate each player’s final **Pollution Score**.  
  - The final result is the **Capital ÷ (1 + Pollution Score)**. (Alternatively, some groups may prefer capital-to-pollution ratio in simpler terms, e.g., “highest ratio wins.”)  
  - The **winner** is the player with the *best (highest) ratio* of capital to pollution.

### 1.5 Economic System

**1.5.1 Currency**  
All transactions use **Eco-Credits (EC)**.

**1.5.2 Dynamic Pricing Mechanisms**  
1. **Terrain Costs**: Based on terrain type and location. Some technologies may lower effective costs (e.g., improved logistics to develop remote areas).  
2. **Factories & Upgrades**: Each factory has a fixed *Construction Cost*, but the *Upgrade Costs* can vary depending on the technology’s supply or synergy with existing infrastructure.  
3. **Resources & Products**: Players may set their own prices to sell goods; if using advanced market rules, supply and demand can shift these prices over time.  
4. **Workers**: Salaries can be *fixed* or can escalate if the demand for certain worker types is high and supply is limited.  
5. **Technologies**: If multiple players want the same tech license, negotiations can result in a higher or lower price.  

**1.5.3 Income Generation**  
- **Selling Finished Products**: Each product has a *Base Market Value*; specialized or high-tech products can fetch higher prices.  
- **Offering Services**: Some factories or technologies (e.g., Advanced Recycling Center) can sell *recycling services* to other players, generating service income.  
- **Trading Resources or Tech**: You may profit by acting as a supplier of raw materials or licensing out proprietary technology.

**1.5.4 Expenses**  
- **Operational Costs**: Each factory must pay *Operational Cost* to produce goods.  
- **Maintenance Costs**: Terrain, technologies, and certain modules have ongoing upkeep.  
- **Salaries**: Workers must be paid each turn.  
- **Taxes**: Carbon taxes (pollution-based).  
- **Fines**: If pollution exceeds a legal threshold.  
- **Investments**: Costs to expand factories, develop new terrain, or fund new technology R&D.

**1.5.5 Balancing the Economy**  
- **Market Fluctuations**: In advanced play, track product surpluses or scarcities to dynamically adjust selling prices.  
- **Resource Depletion**: As resources run out, the cost for remaining resources may rise.  
- **Technological Advancements**: Cheaper and cleaner production processes can shift the market if widely adopted, reducing pollution costs but possibly also lowering product prices if supply becomes abundant.

## 5. PLAYER TUTORIAL



### Step 1: Setting Up the Game
1. **Arrange the Board**: Lay out the 25 or 36 terrain tiles in a grid. Each tile is visible, so you can plan terrain acquisition.  
2. **Initial Purchases**:  
   - Each player starts with 2000 EC.  
   - In turn order, pick 2 terrain tiles to buy (snake draft).  
3. **Optional Factory Build**: If desired, pay the construction cost of **1** factory on each owned terrain tile.  
4. **Hire Workers**: Optionally hire up to 2 workers now, paying their first salary.  
5. **Technology Preview**: Display a handful of technology cards face-up. Each player may purchase **1** if they wish.

### Step 2: Understanding Core Concepts
1. **Terrains**: Different tiles have different resource potential (e.g., Forest for timber, Mountain for mining).  
2. **Factories**: Each factory transforms raw resources into products or services. Each has a unique cost, output, and pollution profile.  
3. **Resources**: You will need input resources like minerals, biomass, or water to operate factories.  
4. **Technologies**: Improve efficiency, reduce pollution, and open up advanced production opportunities.  
5. **Workers**: You must assign skilled workers to run factories. Understaffed factories produce less.

### Step 3: Taking a Turn
1. **Phase A: Resource & Production**  
   - Decide which factories will run this round.  
   - Assign workers. Verify you have enough raw materials.  
   - Calculate outputs and pollution. Add new goods to your inventory or sell them immediately.  
2. **Phase B: Construction & Development**  
   - Buy additional terrain tiles.  
   - Build new factories or upgrade existing ones.  
   - Note how each decision affects your capital and potential pollution.  
3. **Phase C: Worker & Tech Management**  
   - Hire or fire workers, train them for advanced roles.  
   - Purchase or implement new technology cards to gain benefits.  
4. **Phase D: Environmental & Economic Adjustments**  
   - Tally up your pollution and pay the carbon tax.  
   - If your pollution is above thresholds, consider installing *Pollution Control* tech or reforestation.  
   - Adjust product prices if you’re using advanced supply-demand rules.  
5. **Phase E: End of Turn**  
   - Check if end-game is triggered (resource depletion or no more terrain).  
   - Pass play to the next person.

### Step 4: Strategic Considerations
1. **Terrain Choices**: Secure resource-rich or strategically located terrain early.  
2. **Factory Placement**: Build factories close to input resources to reduce transport costs.  
3. **Pollution Management**: Keep your pollution score in check; failing to manage it results in steep taxes.  
4. **Tech Investments**: Early adoption of key technologies (like *Advanced Water Treatment*, *Modular Automation*) can pay off long-term.  
5. **Economic Timing**: Keep enough capital on hand to pay salaries and taxes each round; going into debt is not an option (or house rule could allow loans).  
6. **Worker Specialization**: Skilled labor drastically improves efficiency and reduces pollution. However, each worker’s salary is an ongoing cost.

### Step 5: Economic Management & Investment Strategies
- **Diversify** your factories to reduce risks if one resource is depleted.  
- Use **Industrial Symbiosis** if you own multiple factories that produce complementary byproducts.  
- Focus on **Upgrades** that align with your resource availability and strategic goals (e.g., if you’re near a forest, invest in *Bioplastics Production Facility* plus reforestation for synergy).

### Step 6: Environmental Impact & Mitigation
- Keep an eye on your **Pollution Score** each round.  
- Install **Carbon Capture Modules**, adopt **Urban Afforestation**, or build a **Zero-Liquid-Discharge System** if pollution climbs too high.  
- **Worker** usage can also reduce pollution (Environmental Scientists, Sustainability Consultants).

### Step 7: Final Scoring & Victory
- When resources run dry or all terrain is owned, the game ends.  
- Calculate your **capital** and your **total pollution**.  
- Compute your ratio: **Capital ÷ (1 + Pollution Score)**.  
- The highest ratio wins. Congratulate the winner on achieving sustainable industrial prowess!

## VALIDATION & DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS

1. **Economic Balance**  
   - Costs and benefits are carefully pegged so that no single factory or tech is overwhelmingly dominant.  
   - Supply-demand mechanics and resource depletion encourage a dynamic economy.

2. **Realism**  
   - Real-world processes (e.g., carbon capture, waste management) are represented accurately but streamlined for board game play.  
   - Worker specialization and training reflect realistic skill development.

3. **Clarity**  
   - All rules and card descriptions are straightforward. Players unfamiliar with industrial systems can follow the step-by-step tutorial.

4. **Internal Consistency**  
   - Pollution consistently impacts carbon taxes and final scoring.  
   - Technological synergies are logical and additive.  
   - Worker roles apply uniformly across factories.

5. **Fairness**  
   - Every player starts with the same capital (2000 EC) and no advantage in terrain selection beyond turn order (which can be arranged fairly).  
   - Absence of randomness means outcomes hinge on strategic play.

   Each player can build **one** factory per owned terrain tile (optional):

   - **Anna** decides to build a **Sustainable Forestry Operation** on her Forest tile (construction cost 150 EC, operational cost 20 EC/round). She leaves the Wetlands tile undeveloped for now.  
     - New capital: 1600 - 150 = **1450 EC**  
   
   - **Boris** constructs an **Advanced Recycling Center** on his Urban tile (300 EC), anticipating synergy with future high-tech expansions. Leaves Plains empty initially.  
     - New capital: 1450 - 300 = **1150 EC**  
   
   - **Carly** invests in a **Rare Earth Element Refinery** on her Mountain tile (400 EC). She holds off on building in the Forest.  
     - New capital: 1450 - 400 = **1050 EC**  
   
   - **Dan** opts for a **Vertical Farm** on his Plains tile (250 EC) to quickly generate produce. He leaves the Coastal tile open.  
     - New capital: 1550 - 250 = **1300 EC**

4. **Worker Hiring (Optional)**  
   - **Anna** hires **1 Environmental Scientist** (40 EC/round) to minimize pollution.

   - **Dan** hires **1 Agricultural Technician** (30 EC/round) to operate the vertical farm efficiently.

   No one hires a second worker at setup; they want to preserve capital.

5. **Technology Preview** (Optional Purchase)  
   - 5 technology cards are laid out: **Modular Automation**, **Hybrid Solar-Wind Power**, **Advanced Water Treatment**, **Green Microgrid**, **Carbon Capture Module**.  
   - None of the players buy a technology yet; they prefer to see how production shapes up in the first round.

**Time Taken for Setup**: ~25 minutes (players discuss terrain choices, factories, and initial hires in detail).

  - Pollution: **1**  

- **Boris**’s net spending:  
  - Terrain purchase 350 + Op cost 35 + Carbon tax 25 + Salary 50 = 460 EC.  
  - No product sales.  
  - Start: 1150  
  - End: 1150 - 460 = **690 EC**  
  - Pollution: **5**  

- **Carly**’s net spending:  
  - Op cost 50 + Carbon tax 70 + Salaries 70 = 190 EC.  
  - Start: 1050

  - Salaries: 30 EC (Technician) + 40 EC (Env. Scientist) = 70 EC.  
  - Op cost: 50 EC for the Refinery.  

- **Dan**:  
  - Pollution = 3.  
  - Carbon Tax = 15 EC.  
  - Salaries: 30 EC (Agri Tech) + 35 EC (Logistics Specialist) = 65 EC.  
  - Op cost: 30 EC for the Vertical Farm.  
  - Warehouse has a minimal cost, say 10 EC/round.  

### Phase E: End of Turn & Status Check

- **Anna**  
  - Income: 0 sales.  
  - Expenses: Forestry op (20) + Carbon tax (5) + Salary (40) = 65 + 300 for new factory = 365.  
  - Start: 1385  
  - End: 1385 - 365 = **1020 EC**  
  - Pollution: **1**

- **Boris**  
  - Income: 0 from sales.  
  - Expenses: Carbon tax 25 + Salary 50 + Recycling op 35 + R&D Lab 15 + Modular Automation 30 + 200 (construction) = 355 total.  
  - Start: 690  
  - End: 690 - 355 = **335 EC**  
  - Pollution: **5**

- **Carly**  
  - Income: 0 from sales.  
  - Expenses: Carbon tax 55 + Salaries 70 + Refinery op 50 = 175 total.  
  - Start: 860  
  - End: 860 - 175 = **685 EC**  
  - Pollution: **11**

- **Dan**  
  - Income: 120 from produce sales.  
  - Expenses: Carbon tax 15 + Salaries 65 + Farm op 30 + Warehouse 10 + 150 (construction) = 270.  
  - Net = 120 - 270 = -150.  
  - Start: 1285  
  - End: 1285 - 150 = **1135 EC**  
  - Pollution: **3**

**Player Interactions & Table Talk**  
- Anna (to Dan): *“I might need some biomass or organic waste soon for my bioplastics. Let me know if you have extra produce scraps.”*  
- Dan: *“Sure, I can supply that if we figure out a fair price. Let’s talk next round.”*  
- Boris (jokingly, to Carly): *“Send me your trash, I’ll recycle it! But yeah, I might also be interested in your rare earths for advanced manufacturing.”*  
- Carly: *“I might sell 2 units next round for around 100 EC each. Let’s see.”*

**Time Taken (Round 2)**: ~12 minutes.

---

## ROUND 3

### Phase A: Resource & Production

- **Anna**  
  - Operates **Sustainable Forestry**: +2 Timber, +1 Wood Chips, pollution 1 net.  
  - Fires up the new **Bioplastics Production Facility** using some wood chips as feedstock. She can produce +1 unit of Bioplastics this turn.  
    - Additional pollution from the Bioplastics facility: 6 base, mitigated by her Environmental Scientist (but the Scientist is assigned to forestry?).  
    - Anna decides to have the Scientist split tasks—**house rule** might limit that. Let’s assume only 1 factory can fully benefit. She chooses to keep the Scientist on the more polluting Bioplastics facility.  
    - So Forestry has 4 baseline → net 4 (no scientist). Bioplastics has 6 baseline → net 3 with the Scientist.  
    - Total pollution = 4 + 3 = 7.  

- **Boris**  
  - Recycling Center: Gains 1 unit of Recycled Materials again from city scrap.  
  - The R&D Lab tests *Modular Automation* expansions—no direct product but readies him for advanced factories.  
  - Pollution: Recycling 5 points, R&D Lab ~2 points. Total = 7.  

- **Carly**  
  - Refinery: +2 Rare Earth units. She has 6 total.  
  - With the Env. Scientist fully assigned, baseline 14 → net 11.  
  - Carly decides to sell **2 units** to Boris (negotiated at 90 EC each). Boris uses them to prototype advanced robotics.  

- **Dan**  
  - Vertical Farm: +4 produce. Sells 3 at 30 EC each = 90 EC, keeps 1.  
  - Pollution: 3 from the farm, plus minimal from the warehouse (let’s keep it at 0 direct pollution).  
  - Total = 3.  

### Player Interactions & Negotiations

- **Boris** and **Carly** formalize the **Rare Earth** deal:
  - Carly: *“I need quick cash. 2 units for 180 total.”*  
  - Boris: *“Deal!”*  
  - Payment is immediate. Carly’s capital +180, Boris’s capital -180.

- **Anna** and **Dan** discuss future collaboration:
  - Anna: *“Your produce scraps could be turned into biomass for my bioplastics. Maybe next round we set a fair price?”*  
  - Dan: *“Sure, 1 unit of scraps for 20 EC? We’ll figure out the details.”*

### Phase B: Construction & Development

- **Anna**: No new builds; focusing on offsetting the new pollution from bioplastics.  
- **Boris**: Low on capital (especially after paying Carly 180), decides to wait on new construction.  
- **Carly**: She invests 200 EC to install one **Carbon Capture Module** in the refinery. This will reduce net pollution by 10 points next round.  
- **Dan**: Considers building a **Transport Electrification** system, but sees it costs 800 EC. He doesn’t have enough capital to comfortably do so. Delays.

### Phase C: Worker & Tech Management

- **Anna**: No changes.  
- **Boris**: The 2 Rare Earths he just bought are stored for a future advanced factory (no immediate tech purchase).  
- **Carly**: No new hires, invests in the carbon capture upgrade instead.  
- **Dan**: Trains his Logistics Specialist to an **Advanced Logistics** skill (cost +10 EC/round but cuts an extra 5% from shipping costs).  

### Phase D: Environmental & Economic Adjustments

**Pollution & Carbon Tax**  
- Anna’s total pollution = **7**  
  - Carbon tax = 35 EC  
- Boris’s total pollution = **7**  
  - Carbon tax = 35 EC  
- Carly’s total pollution = **11**  
  - Carbon tax = 55 EC  
- Dan’s total pollution = **3**  
  - Carbon tax = 15 EC  

**Salaries & Maintenance**  
- Anna: Env. Scientist 40 EC. Factory ops: Forestry (20), Bioplastics (35).  
- Boris: Engineer 50 EC; Recycling Center (35), R&D Lab (15), Modular Automation (30).  
- Carly: Technician 30 + Env. Scientist 40 = 70 EC. Refinery op 50. Carbon capture module will start maintenance next round.  
- Dan: Technician 30 + Logistics Specialist (35 + 10 upgrade) = 80 EC total. Farm op 30, warehouse 10.

**Income**  
- Anna: No direct product sale.  
- Boris: Sells 1 unit of Recycled Materials on a local market for 40 EC. (Small revenue.)  
- Carly: Gains 180 EC from Boris for 2 Rare Earth units.  
- Dan: Gains 90 EC from produce.

#### Net Calculations

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 1020  
  - Outflow: Carbon tax 35 + Salaries 40 + Forestry op 20 + Bioplastics op 35 = 130 total.  
  - No inflow.  
  - End: 1020 - 130 = **890 EC**  
  - Pollution: **7**

- **Boris**  
  - Start: 335  
  - Outflow: Carbon tax 35 + Salary 50 + Rec. Center 35 + R&D 15 + Automation 30 + 180 paid to Carly = 345 total.  
  - Inflow: 40 from selling Recycled Materials.  
  - Net = -305.  
  - End: 335 - 305 = **30 EC**  
  - Pollution: **7**  
  - (Boris is nearly broke but has advanced tech potential.)

- **Carly**  
  - Start: 685  
  - Outflow: Carbon tax 55 + Salaries 70 + Refinery 50 + 200 for Carbon Capture installation = 375.  
  - Inflow: 180 from Boris.  
  - Net = -195.  
  - End: 685 - 195 = **490 EC**  
  - Pollution: **11**  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 1135  
  - Outflow: Carbon tax 15 + Salaries 80 + Farm 30 + Warehouse 10 = 135 total.  
  - Inflow: 90 from produce.  
  - Net = -45.  
  - End: 1135 - 45 = **1090 EC**  
  - Pollution: **3**

**Time Taken (Round 3)**: ~15 minutes (negotiations took some time).

---

## ROUND 4

### Phase A: Resource & Production

- **Anna**  
  - Runs Forestry (pollution 4) + Bioplastics (6), but only 1 Env. Scientist can mitigate one location. She chooses Bioplastics again.  
  - Forestry = 4 net; Bioplastics = 6 - 3 = 3 net.  
  - Total pollution = 7 again.  
  - Production: +2 Timber, +1 Wood Chips, +1 Bioplastics. Anna now has 2 Bioplastics total.  

- **Boris**  
  - Recycling Center: +1 Recycled Materials.  
  - R&D Lab: No direct product.  
  - Pollution from both = 7 total.  

- **Carly**  
  - Rare Earth Refinery: Baseline 14. **Carbon Capture Module** installed reduces it by 10. With 1 Env. Scientist also providing -3, how do we apply?  
  - Usually, the module is a direct -10 to that factory’s net. Let’s interpret it as: 14 - 10 = 4, minus 3 = 1 net if the Scientist is assigned there. However, we must confirm if the same Scientist can further reduce after the module or if they’re additive. Typically, yes, they stack.  
  - So Carly’s net pollution from the refinery is **1**. This is a big improvement.  
  - Production: +2 Rare Earth units (she has 6 left after selling 2, so now 8 total).  

- **Dan**  
  - Vertical Farm: +4 produce, sells 4 for 30 EC each = 120 EC.  
  - Pollution: 3 from the farm.  
  - Advanced Logistics might reduce transport pollution if it was big enough, but let’s keep it at net 3.

### Phase B: Construction & Development

- **Anna**  
  - Considers purchasing **Urban Afforestation** for 200 EC on any Urban tile (but she doesn’t have an Urban tile). She passes.  

- **Boris**  
  - Nearly broke at 30 EC. He can’t construct anything.  

- **Carly**  
  - Decides to build a small **Waste Management Upgrade** for 150 EC on her Forest tile to collect biomass. Not an official factory, but analogous to an add-on.  

- **Dan**  
  - Buys a second **Plains** tile (200 EC) to potentially expand farming.  

### Phase C: Worker & Tech Management

- **Anna**: No changes.  
- **Boris**: He’s low on funds, so no new hires. He contemplates short-term loan from Dan or Carly, but that’s a house rule not yet established.  
- **Carly**: No new hires. The carbon capture module is now in effect.  
- **Dan**: No new hires, but invests 50 EC in specialized training for the Agricultural Technician (house-ruled advanced horticulture) for slightly higher yield next round.

### Phase D: Environmental & Economic Adjustments

**Pollution & Carbon Tax**  
- Anna: 7 pollution → 35 EC tax  
- Boris: 7 pollution → 35 EC tax  
- Carly: 1 pollution → 5 EC tax  
- Dan: 3 pollution → 15 EC tax

**Salaries & Maintenance**  
- Anna: 40 (Env. Sci); Forestry op 20, Bioplastics 35  
- Boris: 50 (Eng); Rec Center 35, R&D Lab 15, Automation 30  
- Carly: 70 (Tech + Env Sci); Refinery 50, Carbon Capture 15  
- Dan: 30 (Ag Tech) + 45 (Log. Specialist with upgrade) = 75; Farm 30, Warehouse 10

**Income**  
- Anna: No sales, holding resources.  
- Boris: Possibly sells 1 Recycled Materials again for 40 EC to local businesses.  
- Carly: No direct sale of Rare Earths this round, but she’s open to future trades.  
- Dan: 120 from produce.

#### Net Calculations

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 890  
  - Outflow: 35 (tax) + 40 (salary) + 20 (Forestry) + 35 (Bioplastics) = 130.  
  - Inflow: 0.  
  - End: 890 - 130 = **760 EC**  
  - Pollution = 7  

- **Boris**  
  - Start: 30  
  - Outflow: 35 (tax) + 50 (salary) + 35 (Rec Center) + 15 (R&D) + 30 (Automation) = 165.  
  - Inflow: 40 from recycled materials.  
  - Net = -125.  
  - End: 30 - 125 = **-95 EC** (He is effectively out of money; if the game allows negative, he’s in debt. If not, he’d have to scale back or ask for a loan. Let’s assume negative is allowed with a penalty.)  
  - Pollution = 7  

- **Carly**  
  - Start: 490  
  - Outflow: 5 (tax) + 70 (salary) + 50 (refinery) + 15 (capture maint.) + 150 (waste mgmt build) = 290.  
  - Inflow: 0.  
  - End: 490 - 290 = **200 EC**  
  - Pollution = 1  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 1090  
  - Outflow: 15 (tax) + 75 (salaries) + 30 (farm) + 10 (warehouse) + 200 (new Plains tile) + 50 (training) = 380.  
  - Inflow: 120 produce.  
  - Net = -260.  
  - End: 1090 - 260 = **830 EC**  
  - Pollution = 3  

**Time Taken (Round 4)**: ~10 minutes (faster decisions).

**Key Strategic Moment**: Carly’s pollution drastically drops from 11 to 1 thanks to carbon capture + an Env. Scientist, giving her a big advantage in carbon taxes.

---

## ROUND 5

### Phase A: Resource & Production

- **Anna**  
  - Chooses to keep the Scientist at Bioplastics again: Forestry = 4 pollution, Bioplastics = 6-3=3, total 7.  
  - Gains +2 Timber, +1 Wood Chips, +1 Bioplastics. She now has 3 Bioplastics.  

- **Boris**  
  - Recycling Center: +1 Recycled Materials.  
  - R&D Lab: no direct product.  
  - Pollution = ~7. No new improvements.  

- **Carly**  
  - Refinery: Net 1 pollution again (14 - 10 from capture - 3 from Env. Sci = 1).  
  - +2 Rare Earth units (total ~10). She decides to sell 4 units (2 each) to Anna and Dan:  
    - Anna might want them if she plans an advanced facility, but Anna is short on immediate synergy. She declines.  
    - Dan only wants 1 unit for potential advanced automation. Carly sells 1 unit to Dan for 90 EC, so not a big chunk.  

- **Dan**  
  - Vertical Farm: Enhanced yield from newly trained Tech → +5 produce this round.  
  - Sells 5 at 30 each = 150 EC.  
  - Pollution = 3.

### Player Interactions

- Boris is *desperate* for funds. He offers Dan or Anna a future stake in his advanced R&D in exchange for a short-term investment. Dan is half-interested in a synergy if they build an electric vehicle plant.  
  - Dan: *“I’ll loan you 100 EC for 20% discount on your future advanced factories.”*  
  - Boris: *“Deal. That might keep me afloat.”*  

Boris thus gets +100 EC from Dan, on condition that if Boris constructs an advanced factory, Dan pays only 80% of cost for any products or technology synergy. House rule negotiation, but plausible in a real game.

### Phase B: Construction & Development

- **Anna**  
  - She invests in a **Carbon Capture Module** on the Bioplastics facility for 200 EC, aiming to reduce future pollution.  

- **Boris**  
  - With Dan’s 100 EC loan, he invests 200 EC to **upgrade** the Recycling Center with *Modular Automation* fully. This might boost recycled output to 2 units/turn.  

- **Carly**  
  - No new construction; she focuses on reaping the low pollution advantage.  

- **Dan**  
  - Buys a small **Transport Electrification** pilot add-on for 400 EC (not the full 800 version, but partial synergy that reduces transport pollution by 5 points total).  

### Phase C: Worker & Tech Management

- **Anna**: No new hires.  
- **Boris**: Maintains current staff, invests in the automation upgrade for the recycling center.  
- **Carly**: No changes.  
- **Dan**: No changes.

### Phase D: Environmental & Economic Adjustments

**Pollution & Carbon Tax**  
- Anna: 7 pollution → 35 EC tax (the newly installed carbon capture module will reduce pollution next round).  
- Boris: 7 pollution → 35 EC tax.  
- Carly: 1 pollution → 5 EC tax.  
- Dan: 3 pollution → 15 EC tax, with partial electrification helping next round.

**Salaries & Maintenance**  
- Anna: 40 (Env Sci), 20 (Forestry), 35 (Bioplastics). +0 so far for carbon capture (15 EC/round starts next turn).  
- Boris: 50 (Eng), Rec Center 35, R&D Lab 15, Automation 30. Now an additional 20 EC for the new factory automation upgrade.  
- Carly: 70 salaries, 50 refinery, 15 carbon capture.  
- Dan: 75 salaries, 30 farm, 10 warehouse, partial transport electrification +20 EC.  

**Income**  
- Anna: No direct sale again.  
- Boris: Possibly sells 2 Recycled Materials for 80 EC total.  
- Carly: Sells 1 Rare Earth to Dan for 90 EC.  
- Dan: Gains 150 from produce.

#### Net Calculations

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 760  
  - Outflow: 35 (tax) + 40 (salary) + 20 (Forestry op) + 35 (Bioplastics op) + 200 (new carbon capture module) = 330.  
  - End: 760 - 330 = **430 EC**  
  - Pollution = 7  

- **Boris**  
  - Start: -95  
  - Gains 100 from Dan (loan), so effectively 5 EC.  
  - Income 80 from selling Recycled Materials → total 85.  
  - Outflow: 35 (tax) + 50 (salary) + 35 (Rec Center) + 15 (R&D) + 30 (Automation) + 20 (new upgrade maintenance) + 200 (upgrade cost) = 385.  
  - End: 85 - 385 = **-300 EC** (still heavily in debt).  
  - Pollution = 7  

- **Carly**  
  - Start: 200  
  - Income: 90 from Dan.  
  - Outflow: 5 (tax) + 70 (salaries) + 50 (refinery) + 15 (capture) = 140.  
  - End: 200 + 90 - 140 = **150 EC**  
  - Pollution = 1  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 830  
  - Income: 150 produce sold.  
  - Outflow: 15 (tax) + 75 (salaries) + 30 (farm) + 10 (warehouse) + 400 (partial electrification) = 530.  
  - Net = 150 - 530 = -380.  
  - End: 830 - 380 = **450 EC**  
  - Pollution = 3  

**Time Taken (Round 5)**: ~15 minutes (negotiations + partial loan arrangements).

---

## ROUND 6 (Potential End-Game Trigger Check)

By Round 6, many prime resource tiles (Mountains, Forests, etc.) are claimed, but not fully depleted. The game might continue, but let’s say players decide to do a final round due to time constraints. They collectively agree: **Round 6 is the final round**.

### Phase A: Resource & Production

- **Anna**  
  - Now the **Carbon Capture Module** on Bioplastics is active: the facility’s pollution is 6 - 10 (but can’t go below 0, so effectively 0) + synergy with the Env. Scientist? Typically, a negative result means 0.  
  - Forestry is 4 pollution. If the Scientist is at Forestry, that’s 4 - 3=1; Bioplastics is 0 because the module alone is enough.  
  - Anna’s total pollution = **1**.  
  - Production: +2 Timber, +1 Wood Chips, +1 Bioplastics. She has 4 Bioplastics now.  

- **Boris**  
  - Recycling Center with new automation: Now yields +2 Recycled Materials per round.  
  - Pollution for the center might be 5 baseline, automation adds some extra energy usage → let’s keep total at 6. R&D Lab at 2. Total ~8.  
  - Eng. can’t mitigate pollution alone, so net is 8.  

- **Carly**  
  - Refinery with carbon capture + Env. Scientist: 14 - 10 - 3 = 1.  
  - +2 Rare Earth units again, final total 12.  

- **Dan**  
  - Farm with advanced tech: +5 produce.  
  - Partially electrified transport: reduces overall transport pollution by 5.  
  - The farm’s 3 might be offset by -5 from electrification, so net is 0 if we apply it. This depends on how the group interprets synergy. Let’s say Dan’s total pollution is **0** for the final round.  

### Phase B: Construction & Development

With final round decided, large capital investments are less appealing:

- Anna: No new builds.  
- Boris: No capital left.  
- Carly: No significant new build.  
- Dan: No new build.  

### Phase C: Worker & Tech Management

- Minimal changes. Everyone focuses on final production and minimal pollution.

### Phase D: Environmental & Economic Adjustments

**Pollution & Carbon Tax**  
- Anna: 1 → 5 EC tax  
- Boris: 8 → 40 EC tax  
- Carly: 1 → 5 EC tax  
- Dan: 0 → 0 EC tax

**Salaries & Maintenance**  
- Anna: 40 (Env Sci), Forestry 20, Bioplastics 35, Carbon capture 15  
- Boris: 50 (Eng), Rec Center 35, R&D 15, Automation 30, upgrade 20  
- Carly: 70 (Tech+Env Sci), Refinery 50, Capture 15  
- Dan: 75 (workers), Farm 30, warehouse 10, partial electrification 20

**Income**  
- **Anna**: Finally decides to sell 4 Bioplastics at 50 EC each to local packaging companies → 200 EC.  
- **Boris**: Sells 2 Recycled Materials for 80 EC total.  
- **Carly**: Sells 4 Rare Earths to a local electronics firm for 90 EC each → 360 EC.  
- **Dan**: Sells 5 produce for 30 each → 150 EC.

#### Net Calculations (Final Tally)

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 430  
  - Income: 200  
  - Outflow: 5 (tax) + 40 (Env Sci) + 20 (Forestry) + 35 (Bioplastics) + 15 (capture maint.) = 115  
  - Net = +85  
  - Final capital = 430 + 85 = **515 EC**  
  - Final pollution = **1**  

- **Boris**  
  - Start: -300  
  - Income: 80  
  - Outflow: 40 (tax) + 50 (Eng) + 35 (Rec) + 15 (R&D) + 30 (Automation) + 20 (upgrade) = 190  
  - Net = 80 - 190 = -110  
  - Final capital = -300 - 110 = **-410 EC** (deep debt)  
  - Final pollution = **8**  

- **Carly**  
  - Start: 150  
  - Income: 360  
  - Outflow: 5 (tax) + 70 (staff) + 50 (refinery) + 15 (capture) = 140  
  - Net = +220  
  - Final capital = 150 + 220 = **370 EC**  
  - Final pollution = **1**  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 450  
  - Income: 150  
  - Outflow: 0 (tax) + 75 (salaries) + 30 (farm) + 10 (warehouse) + 20 (electrification) = 135  
  - Net = +15  
  - Final capital = 450 + 15 = **465 EC**  
  - Final pollution = **0**

### End-Game: Victory Calculation

Using the ratio: **Capital ÷ (1 + Pollution)**

- **Anna**: Capital = 515; Pollution = 1  
  - Ratio = 515 ÷ (1 + 1) = 515 / 2 = 257.5  

- **Boris**: Capital = -410; Pollution = 8  
  - Ratio = -410 ÷ (1 + 8) = -410 / 9 ≈ -45.56  
  - (He’s effectively last place due to heavy debt and moderate pollution.)

- **Carly**: Capital = 370; Pollution = 1  
  - Ratio = 370 ÷ 2 = 185  

- **Dan**: Capital = 465; Pollution = 0  
  - Ratio = 465 ÷ (1 + 0) = 465 / 1 = **465**  

**Dan** wins handily with a ratio of **465**, benefiting from minimal pollution and steady produce income. Anna finishes second (257.5), Carly third (185), Boris last in negative capital territory.

**Table Talk & Reactions**  
- Dan: *“Zero pollution for the final round! That’s how we do sustainable logistics.”*  
- Anna: *“I tried to keep my pollution low, but I see your produce money overshadowed my slow sales.”*  
- Carly: *“That carbon capture paid off big time. If only I’d invested earlier… still, decent ratio.”*  
- Boris (laughing): *“I should’ve built an actual advanced factory earlier, not just R&D. Next time I’ll manage finances better.”*

**Time Taken (Round 6)**: ~10 minutes.

---

## POST-GAME DISCUSSION & NOTES

- **Overall Game Length**: ~2 hours total (25 min setup + ~1 hour 15 min for 6 rounds + 20 min of negotiation/discussions in between).  
- **Rule Adherence**: No major violations, though a few “house rule” negotiations (loans, partial expansions) came up.  
- **Player Strategies**:  
  - **Anna** balanced ecology with moderate product output.  
  - **Boris** tried to develop high-tech synergy but ran out of capital.  
  - **Carly** overcame high pollution quickly with carbon capture, stabilizing near the end.  
  - **Dan** combined agriculture + partial electrification to keep a low pollution footprint and steady profit.  
- **Potential Pacing Issues**:  
  - Early rounds were a bit slow due to learning. Negotiations lengthened some phases.  
- **Interaction Quality**:  
  - Trading of resources, small loan, synergy between produce/waste and recycling.  
- **Clarity of Victory Conditions**:  
  - All players understood the final ratio-based scoring.  
- **Analysis Paralysis**:  
  - Minor, mostly for Boris who juggled multiple tech ideas.  

**Conclusion**: The final outcome crowned **Dan** as the winner with an impressive capital-to-pollution ratio, showcasing how a low-pollution, high-efficiency strategy can pay off in *Eco-Factory Challenge*.

## 2. COMPONENTS

### 2.1 Board & Terrain

- **Board Layout**: A **4×5** grid of terrain tiles (total 20 tiles), ideal for 4 players.  
- **Terrain Types**:  
  1. **Plains (P)**: Medium cost, good for agriculture, moderate building.  
  2. **Forest (F)**: Higher cost, can yield timber, but can also serve as a carbon sink.  
  3. **Mountain (M)**: Rich in minerals, higher pollution risk.  
  4. **Coastal (C)**: Medium cost, access to shipping routes, possible carbon-capture.  
  5. **Urban (U)**: High cost, large factory capacity, but higher potential pollution taxes.  

Each tile shows:  
- **Purchase Cost** (e.g., 200–350 EC).  
- **Resource Potential** (like Timber or Minerals).  
- **Carbon Offset** if left partially undeveloped (e.g., Forest or reforested areas).  

### 2.2 Currencies & Tracking

- **Eco-Credits (EC)**: Primary currency for all transactions.  
- **Pollution Points** (PP): A single track for total pollution (encompassing air, water, etc.).  

### 2.3 Factories

Each factory card has:  
- **Name** (e.g., Solar Panel Assembly, Mining Facility, Recycling Center).  
- **Construction Cost** (EC).  
- **Operational Cost** (EC per round).  
- **Input / Output** (resource requirement vs. products or services).  
- **Base Pollution** (in PP per round).  
- **Space Requirement** (some factories can share a tile if a specific technology is used).  

### 2.4 Technologies

- **Technology Cards**: Each has:  
  - **Name**  
  - **Effect on Factories or Terrain**  
  - **Cost** (Initial + Maintenance)  
  - **Pollution Modifier** (reduces or increases PP)  
  - **Prerequisites** (optional; fewer than before)  

### 2.5 Workers

A simpler worker system:
- **Workers** come in a few specialized roles—**Engineer, Technician, Environmental Advisor**—with straightforward benefits.  
- **Universal Workers** can be assigned to less-specialized tasks but give lower production efficiency.  

### 2.6 Summary of Changes in This Revision

- Fewer terrain tiles and *no random events*, so the game reliably completes in **4–6 rounds**.  
- Each round is deliberately structured to reduce downtime.  
- Pollution offset and carbon credit systems can help players who fall behind in capital.

## 3. COMPLETE REVISED GAME RULES

### 3.1 Game Setup

1. **Board Layout**  
   - Arrange a **4×5** grid of terrain tiles face-up (20 total).  
   - Each tile has a known cost and potential resources.

2. **Player Starting Resources**  
   - Each player starts with **1500 EC** (slightly less than prior versions to speed up decisions).  
   - Each player has **0 PP** initially.

3. **Terrain Draft**  
   - In turn order (alphabetical or another fair method), each player selects **2 tiles** to purchase. The cost is deducted from their starting EC.  
   - Example purchase costs: Plains 200 EC, Forest 250 EC, Mountain 300 EC, Coastal 250 EC, Urban 350 EC.  
   - If a tile is too expensive, the player can skip or buy a cheaper one. Continue until each has 2 tiles.

4. **Optional First Factory Build**  
   - Each player may build **1** factory on any one of their terrain tiles. Pay the construction cost.  
   - Optionally hire **1** worker (an Engineer or Technician or Environmental Advisor) at setup.  

5. **Starting Tech (Optional)**  
   - Reveal 3 technology cards. Each player may buy **one** at the start if desired.

### 3.2 Turn Structure

Each game round has **4 phases**, repeated for 4–6 rounds until an agreed victory trigger:

1. **Production Phase**  
   - Operate factories: gather resources or produce goods.  
   - Assign workers: Each worker can staff only one factory per round.  
   - Pay operational costs + generate base pollution.  

2. **Construction & Technology Phase**  
   - Buy new terrain (if any remain).  
   - Construct new factories or upgrades.  
   - Purchase or implement technology cards.  

3. **Trade & Negotiation Phase**  
   - Freely trade resources, sell goods, or negotiate deals.  
   - Player-to-player trades are possible (no randomness).  

4. **Maintenance & Pollution Phase**  
   - Calculate total pollution from factory operations.  
   - Pay carbon tax: **Tax = 5 EC × (Pollution Points)**.  
   - Apply any pollution mitigation from technologies or forest offsets.  
   - Pay worker salaries, factory maintenance.  

**End of Round**: Check victory triggers. If not met, move to the next round.

### 3.3 End-Game Conditions & Victory

1. **Round Limit**: The game typically ends after the **6th round** or earlier if:  
   - All resource tiles are purchased and mostly depleted.  
   - Players mutually agree to stop (e.g., if expansions no longer make sense).  

2. **Final Scoring**  
   - Compute each player’s **Capital** (remaining EC).  
   - Compute **Total Pollution** (PP).  
   - **Score = Capital ÷ (1 + Total Pollution)**.  
   - Highest score wins.  

### 3.4 Economy & Pollution System

1. **Resources Simplified**  
   - **Raw Materials**: Timber, Minerals, Agricultural Produce, Recycled Materials.  
   - Factories convert raw to finished goods (e.g., Bioplastics, Energy Systems, etc.).  
   - No separate tracking for multiple sub-resources; group them into categories for easier handling.

2. **Pollution**  
   - Single track (PP). Each factory or action adds a certain baseline.  
   - Some technologies, terrain types (Forests left intact), or worker expertise reduce PP.  
   - Carbon tax is paid each round: 5 EC × PP.

3. **Catch-Up Mechanic**  
   - **Carbon Credits**: If a player invests in reforestation (or other green projects) above a certain threshold, they earn carbon credits that offset taxes or can be sold to other players.  

### 3.5 Worker System Simplified

- **Engineer (Salary 50 EC/round)**  
  - +20% production in high-tech factories, or +10% in standard factories.  
  - Slightly reduces breakdown risk (if using advanced rules).  

- **Technician (Salary 30 EC/round)**  
  - Ensures stable basic production, needed for mining or heavy industries.  
  - No direct pollution reduction but ensures full capacity.  

- **Environmental Advisor (Salary 40 EC/round)**  
  - Reduces total factory pollution by 3 PP where assigned.  
  - Required for certain eco-upgrades.  

- **Universal Worker (Salary 20 EC/round)**  
  - No special skill bonus or pollution reduction, but cheaper.  
  - Used for simpler tasks or bridging staff shortages.

### 3.6 Additional Rules/Improvements

1. **Simplified Market**  
   - Players can sell finished goods for a fixed **Base Price** (e.g., 50 EC per unit) or trade with each other for customized deals.  
   - No advanced supply/demand fluctuations—speeds up gameplay.

2. **Streamlined Upgrades**  
   - Each factory can hold up to **2 upgrades** (tech modules) for simpler management.  
   - Upgrades are universal in cost (e.g., 200 EC to install, 10 EC/round maintenance) but differ by effect (pollution reduction, production boost, etc.).

3. **Faster Terrain Development**  
   - Each terrain tile can hold either **1 major factory** or **2 small factories** if you purchase the “Compact Infrastructure” technology.  
   - This lets players expand faster without needing multiple new tiles.

## 7. REVISED PLAYER TUTORIAL


### 7.1 Setup Example

1. **Lay Out the Board**  
   - Shuffle or arrange the 20 Terrain tiles (4×5). Each tile is face-up, so you can see its cost and resource potential.  

2. **Distribute Starting EC**  
   - Each player takes 1500 Eco-Credits.  

3. **Draft Terrain**  
   - In turn order, pick 2 tiles each (pay their cost). Mark them with your color.  

4. **Initial Factory & Worker**  
   - Optionally build 1 factory on any of your 2 tiles. Pay its Construction Cost.  
   - Optionally hire 1 worker (Engineer, Technician, or Environmental Advisor).  

5. **Reveal 3 Tech Cards**  
   - Each player may buy 1 if they wish (pay cost + note maintenance).

### 7.2 Gameplay Example (Round Structure)

Let’s walk through a sample round.

#### Phase 1: Production
- Decide which factories to run. Pay each factory’s Operational Cost.  
- Assign workers. If a factory lacks required workers, it runs at partial capacity (or not at all).  
- Gather produced goods (Timber, Bioplastics, etc.) or intangible services (Consultancy).  
- Add up your **Pollution Points** (PP) from each active factory.

#### Phase 2: Construction & Technology
- Buy a new terrain tile if you want (and if any remain).  
- Build a new factory on a tile you own OR add an upgrade (e.g., *Carbon Capture System*).  
- Purchase a new Tech Card if available. Immediately pay the cost.

#### Phase 3: Trade & Negotiation
- Sell your goods to the bank at base prices, or trade with other players (e.g., *“I’ll give you 2 Timber for 1 Recycled Material”*).  
- Negotiate any worker exchanges or short-term deals if house rules allow.

#### Phase 4: Maintenance & Pollution
- **Carbon Tax**: Pay 5 EC × total PP.  
- **Tech Maintenance**: Pay the maintenance cost for each Tech Card you own.  
- **Worker Salaries**: Pay each worker’s salary.  
- Adjust your final capital after these expenses.

**End of Round**: Check if the round limit (e.g., 6 rounds) is reached or any end-game triggers are met.

### 7.3 Important Tips & Strategies

1. **Balance Economic Growth vs. Pollution**  
   - High-output factories yield more goods but can spike pollution.  
   - Use Environmental Advisors or carbon capture to keep pollution in check.

2. **Focus on a Few Key Factories**  
   - Don’t spread yourself too thin. Upgrading existing factories might be better than building more.

3. **Plan Tech Synergies**  
   - For example, a Bioplastics Plant plus *Bioplastic Synthesis Upgrade* can drastically boost revenue if you have farmland or timber.

4. **Watch Your Finances**  
   - Salaries, maintenance, and carbon taxes can quickly drain capital. Calculate each round carefully.

5. **End-Game Timing**  
   - Because the game typically ends by Round 6, be mindful of your ratio—capital vs. pollution. Accumulating huge pollution late might ruin your final score.

### 7.4 Example Quick Start

- **Round 1**:
  - Build a Crop Farm on a Plains tile. Hire 1 Technician. Produce 3 Agriculture units.  
  - Pay 25 EC operation cost, 30 EC salary, generate 2 PP → 10 EC carbon tax.  
- **Round 2**:
  - Upgrade the farm with *Bioplastic Synthesis* for 200 EC. Now you convert 2 Agriculture units into 2 Bioplastics, sold at 50 EC each.  
  - Pay 10 EC/round for maintenance, keep an eye on pollution.  
- **Rounds 3–6**:
  - Expand terrain or add factories only if you can handle the pollution and cost.  
  - Acquire an Environmental Advisor to reduce pollution from your next big factory.

---

## 8. VALIDATION & DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS

- **Reduced Complexity**:  
  - Fewer terrain tiles (4×5) for faster turn cycles.  
  - Consolidated resource categories.  
  - Single pollution track, straightforward carbon tax.  

- **Faster Game Pace**:  
  - Typical game ends in ~6 rounds, each round taking ~10–15 minutes with 4 players, ~1–1.5 hours total.  

- **Clarity & Accessibility**:  
  - Worker roles are distinct but fewer.  
  - Tech Cards have uniform format and simpler synergy.  

- **Educational Value**:  
  - Players still experience the tension between profit-making and pollution control.  
  - Clear demonstration of how technology, worker expertise, and terrain type matter in real-world sustainability.  

- **Fairness & Strategy**:  
  - All players start with the same capital, no luck-based mechanics.  
  - Strategic planning, trading, and synergy management determine the winner.

---

## 2. GAME SETUP

### 2.1 Terrain Layout

A **4×5 grid** of 20 face-up terrain tiles is placed, each showing cost and type:

- **6 Plains (P)**: cost 200 each  
- **5 Forest (F)**: cost 250 each  
- **3 Mountain (M)**: cost 300 each  
- **3 Coastal (C)**: cost 250 each  
- **3 Urban (U)**: cost 350 each  

*(We won’t list every tile coordinate, but know they are all visible to players.)*

### 2.2 Starting Resources

- Each player has **1500 Eco-Credits (EC)**.  
- All start with **0 Pollution Points (PP)**.  

### 2.3 Terrain Draft

Turn order: **Anna → Ben → Clara → Dan**, then reverse for second pick.

1. **Anna** picks a **Forest (F)** (250 EC).  
2. **Ben** picks an **Urban (U)** (350 EC).  
3. **Clara** picks a **Mountain (M)** (300 EC).  
4. **Dan** picks a **Plains (P)** (200 EC).  
5. **Dan** picks a second tile: a **Coastal (C)** (250 EC).  
6. **Clara** then picks a **Forest (F)** (250 EC).  
7. **Ben** picks a **Plains (P)** (200 EC).  
8. **Anna** picks another **Forest (F)** (250 EC).

**Total terrain spend**:
- Anna: 250 + 250 = 500 → Remaining: 1000 EC  
- Ben: 350 + 200 = 550 → Remaining: 950 EC  
- Clara: 300 + 250 = 550 → Remaining: 950 EC  
- Dan: 200 + 250 = 450 → Remaining: 1050 EC  

### 2.4 Initial Factories & Workers (Optional)

Each may build **1 factory** on one of their tiles and optionally hire **1 worker**.

- **Anna**: Builds a **Timber Logging Camp** on one Forest (cost 150 EC). Hires **1 Environmental Advisor** (salary 40 EC/round).  
  - New capital: 1000 - 150 = 850 EC  
- **Ben**: Builds an **Urban Manufacturing Plant** on Urban tile (cost 300 EC). Hires **1 Engineer** (50 EC/round).  
  - New capital: 950 - 300 = 650 EC  
- **Clara**: Builds a **Mine & Smelter** on Mountain tile (cost 300 EC). Hires **1 Technician** (30 EC/round).  
  - New capital: 950 - 300 = 650 EC  
- **Dan**: Builds a **Crop Farm** on Plains tile (cost 200 EC). No worker hired yet.  
  - New capital: 1050 - 200 = 850 EC  

### 2.5 Revealing Starting Tech Cards

Three technology cards are revealed:

1. **Advanced Automation Module** (Cost 200 EC, 15 EC/round maintenance, +20% production)  
2. **Carbon Capture System** (Cost 250 EC, 20 EC/round, -6 PP in assigned factory)  
3. **Industrial Recycling Unit** (Cost 200 EC, 15 EC/round, +5 EC/round revenue & -3 PP from waste)

No one buys them immediately at setup. Players want to see how initial production goes.

**Time for Setup**: ~15 minutes (discussion, reading terrain, deciding factories).

---

## 3. ROUND 1

**Time Estimate**: ~10 minutes

### Phase 1: Production

- **Anna**:  
  - **Timber Logging Camp** (Forest).  
  - Operational Cost = 20 EC. Produces 2 Timber units, Pollution = 3 PP base.  
  - The Environmental Advisor reduces it by 3 → Net 0 PP this turn.  
  - Anna pays 20 EC operation.  

- **Ben**:  
  - **Urban Manufacturing Plant**.  
  - Operational Cost = 35 EC. However, to produce goods, he needs 2 Mineral/Recycled inputs. He doesn’t have any.  
  - He runs the factory at partial capacity, effectively producing 1 Manufactured Goods unit (house-ruled minimal production).  
  - Pollution = 6 PP (the Engineer doesn’t reduce pollution, but does raise production from 0 to 1 unit).  

- **Clara**:  
  - **Mine & Smelter** (Mountain).  
  - Operational Cost = 40 EC. Produces 2 Mineral units.  
  - Pollution = 8 PP. The Technician ensures stable operation but no pollution discount.  

- **Dan**:  
  - **Crop Farm** (Plains).  
  - Operational Cost = 25 EC. No worker, so output is 3 Agriculture units (the farm’s baseline).  
  - Pollution = 2 PP.

### Phase 2: Construction & Technology

- **Anna**: No new construction.  
- **Ben**: Buys **Advanced Automation Module** for 200 EC, hoping to boost future production.  
- **Clara**: No additional builds yet—she wants to gather capital from selling minerals.  
- **Dan**: Buys a second **Crop Farm** on his Coastal tile (but that’s suboptimal—actually, let’s say he waits). He decides to hold off for now.

### Phase 3: Trade & Negotiation

- **Anna** has 2 Timber units. She might hold them to build a Bioplastics Plant in the future.  
- **Ben** only has 1 Manufactured Good, which he can sell for ~50 EC base price. He decides to keep it for now, possibly to trade for minerals or timber.  
- **Clara** has 2 Minerals. She offers 1 Mineral to Ben for 50 EC.  
  - Ben: “I might buy that next round. My capital’s tight, so let’s wait.”  
- **Dan** has 3 Agriculture units, no immediate deals. He contemplates selling them to the market next phase.

*(No major trades occur this round.)*

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Pollution

1. **Pollution & Carbon Tax**  
   - Anna: 0 PP → 0 carbon tax.  
   - Ben: 6 PP → 6 × 5 = 30 EC.  
   - Clara: 8 PP → 40 EC.  
   - Dan: 2 PP → 10 EC.

2. **Worker Salaries & Tech Maintenance**  
   - Anna: 40 EC for Environmental Advisor.  
   - Ben: 50 EC for Engineer + 15 EC (maintenance for new Advanced Automation Module).  
   - Clara: 30 EC for Technician.  
   - Dan: 0 (no worker hired yet).  

3. **Income from Selling Goods** (optional)  
   - Dan sells 2 of his 3 Agriculture units to the bank at 25 EC each (a slightly lower base if we assume 25–30 EC for raw produce). Gains 50 EC. Keeps 1 for potential trade or future use.  

4. **Net End-of-Round Capital Changes**  

- **Anna**:  
  - Start: 850 EC  
  - Outflow: 20 (operation) + 40 (salary) + 0 (tax) = 60  
  - No sale of Timber.  
  - End: 850 - 60 = **790 EC**, Pollution = **0**  

- **Ben**:  
  - Start: 650 EC  
  - Outflow: 35 (operation) + 30 (tax) + 50 (Engineer) + 15 (automation maintenance) + 200 (buying the module) = 330  
  - End: 650 - 330 = **320 EC**, Pollution = **6**  

- **Clara**:  
  - Start: 650 EC  
  - Outflow: 40 (operation) + 40 (tax) + 30 (Technician) = 110  
  - End: 650 - 110 = **540 EC**, Pollution = **8**  

- **Dan**:  
  - Start: 850 EC  
  - Outflow: 25 (operation) + 10 (tax) = 35  
  - Inflow: 50 (produce sold)  
  - Net: +15  
  - End: 850 + 15 = **865 EC**, Pollution = **2**  

**Key Strategic Moments**:
- Ben invests heavily in automation but is left with only 320 EC, generating significant early pollution.
- Clara’s big polluter might hamper her finances from carbon tax.

**Time Taken (Round 1)**: ~10 minutes.

## 4. ROUND 2

**Time Estimate**: ~10-12 minutes

### Phase 1: Production

- **Anna** (Forestry)  
  - Logging Camp: Pays 20 EC operational. +2 Timber, 3 PP base → -3 from Advisor = 0 PP.  

- **Ben** (Urban Plant w/ Automation)  
  - Operational Cost 35 EC. Automation adds +20% production, but still short on consistent inputs.  
  - Produces 1.2 → round to 1 or 2 units of Manufactured Goods (house rule might set it to 2 if partial inputs exist). Let’s say 2 units for demonstration.  
  - Pollution: Base 6, no reduction → 6 PP.  

- **Clara** (Mine & Smelter)  
  - 40 EC operational. +2 Minerals, 8 PP. No new worker or tech to reduce it.  

- **Dan** (Crop Farm, no worker)  
  - 25 EC operational. +3 Agriculture, 2 PP.  

### Phase 2: Construction & Technology

- **Anna**: Buys a **Bioplastics Plant** (250 EC) on her second Forest tile. She’ll feed it timber.  
- **Ben**: No new construction. Low on capital (320 EC).  
- **Clara**: Considers building a **Recycling Center** (200 EC) on her Forest tile to reduce pollution synergy, but decides to wait one more round to see if she can get a technology for waste management.  
- **Dan**: Builds a second **Crop Farm** on the Coastal tile (200 EC). He can produce more agriculture to sell.

### Phase 3: Trade & Negotiation

- **Anna** & **Dan** talk:  
  - Anna: “If you have spare Agriculture, I’ll need biomass for my Bioplastics soon.”  
  - Dan: “Sure, I can sell you 2 Agriculture for 40 each next round—slightly better than the bank rate.”  
- **Ben** & **Clara**:  
  - Clara offers 2 Minerals to Ben for 80 EC total. Ben can use them to produce full goods next round.  
  - Ben: “I’m at 320 EC, but ok, I’ll buy them for 80.”  
  - That leaves Ben with 240 EC.  

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Pollution

1. **Pollution & Tax**  
   - Anna: 0 PP → 0 tax  
   - Ben: 6 PP → 30 EC  
   - Clara: 8 PP → 40 EC  
   - Dan: 2 PP → 10 EC  

2. **Worker Salaries & Tech Maintenance**  
   - Anna: 40 EC (Env. Advisor).  
   - Ben: 50 EC (Engineer) + 15 EC (automation).  
   - Clara: 30 EC (Technician).  
   - Dan: no workers.  

3. **Operation & Build Costs**  
   - Anna: +250 EC spent for Bioplastics Plant.  
   - Dan: +200 EC spent for second Crop Farm.  

4. **Sales**  
   - Anna: Holds her Timber for the Bioplastics facility (which starts next round).  
   - Ben: Sells 2 Manufactured Goods @ 50 each = 100 EC.  
   - Clara: Might sell 2 Minerals @ 40 each to the bank if she wants. Instead, she sold them to Ben for 80 total earlier.  
   - Dan: Sells all 3 Agriculture @ 25 each = 75 EC.  

#### Net Capital Tally

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 790  
  - Outflow: 20 (logging op) + 40 (salary) + 0 (tax) + 250 (new factory) = 310  
  - No immediate revenue.  
  - End: 790 - 310 = **480 EC**, Pollution = **0**  

- **Ben**  
  - Start: 320  
  - Outflow: 35 (urban op) + 30 (tax) + 50 (eng) + 15 (automation) + 80 (minerals from Clara) = 210  
  - Income: 100 (manufactured goods)  
  - Net: -110  
  - End: 320 - 110 = **210 EC**, Pollution = **6**  

- **Clara**  
  - Start: 540  
  - Outflow: 40 (mine op) + 40 (tax) + 30 (tech) = 110  
  - Income: 80 from selling minerals to Ben  
  - Net: -30  
  - End: 540 - 30 = **510 EC**, Pollution = **8**  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 865  
  - Outflow: 25 (farm) + 10 (tax) + 200 (new farm) = 235  
  - Income: 75 (3 Agriculture)  
  - Net: -160  
  - End: 865 - 160 = **705 EC**, Pollution = **2**  

**Key Moments**:
- Anna invests in Bioplastics.  
- Ben finalizes a deal for minerals, but his funds are critically low.  
- Dan expanding farmland, might soon overshadow others in raw product volume.

**Time (Round 2)**: ~12 minutes.

---

## 5. ROUND 3

**Time Estimate**: ~10 minutes

### Phase 1: Production

- **Anna**:  
  - **Logging Camp**: +2 Timber, 3 PP - 3 Advisor = 0 net PP, 20 EC operational.  
  - **Bioplastics Plant** (just built): She must pay 30 EC op cost, uses 1 Timber as input, produces 1 or 2 Bioplastics. Pollution 5 PP base, minus 0 because the Env. Advisor is still at the Logging Camp? Or reassign?  
    - Anna reassigns the Advisor to Bioplastics. Then Logging Camp goes full 3 PP. Let’s see:  
      - Logging Camp = 3 PP, no Advisor.  
      - Bioplastics = 5 PP, minus 3 from Advisor = 2 PP.  
      - Total = 5 PP.  

- **Ben**:  
  - Now he has 2 Minerals from Clara. The Urban Plant with Automation can produce 2–3 goods. Let’s assume 2.5 → 2 or 3 units. We pick 3 for advantage.  
  - Operational cost 35. Pollution 6 PP.  

- **Clara**:  
  - Mine & Smelter: 40 EC op. +2 Minerals, 8 PP. No changes.  

- **Dan**:  
  - **First Farm** (Plains): 25 EC op, +3 Agriculture, 2 PP.  
  - **Second Farm** (Coastal): Another 25 EC op, +3 Agriculture, 2 PP.  
  - Total pollution from farms = 4 PP.

### Phase 2: Construction & Technology

- **Anna**: Buys a **Carbon Capture System** for her Bioplastics Plant (250 EC). Maintenance is 20 EC/round but will reduce it by 6 PP.  
- **Ben**: No new construction; capital is only 210 EC.  
- **Clara**: Decides to buy the **Industrial Recycling Unit** (200 EC, 15 EC/round) to attach to her Mine & Smelter, hoping to cut pollution by 3.  
- **Dan**: Hires **1 Technician** (30 EC/round) to operate both farms more efficiently.  

### Phase 3: Trade & Negotiation

- **Anna** & **Dan** finalize a small trade: Anna buys 2 Agriculture from Dan at 40 EC each = 80 EC (anticipating more Bioplastics next round).  
- **Ben** sells 1 or 2 Manufactured Goods to Clara for 50 EC each. Clara might resell them or keep them, but let’s say she declines for now because it doesn’t tie directly into her mining strategy.  
- Clara might hold her minerals to sell to the bank or wait for a better offer from Ben. She sells 2 to the bank at 40 each = 80 total if she needs quick cash.  

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Pollution

1. **Pollution**  
   - **Anna**:  
     - Logging Camp (3 PP) + Bioplastics (5 PP - 3 from Advisor = 2) = 5 total.  
     - She purchased Carbon Capture this phase, but it activates next round.  
   - **Ben**: 6 PP from the Urban Plant.  
   - **Clara**: 8 PP from the Mine. The Industrial Recycling Unit starts next round.  
   - **Dan**: 4 PP total from 2 farms.

2. **Carbon Tax (5 EC × PP)**  
   - Anna: 5 PP → 25 EC  
   - Ben: 6 PP → 30 EC  
   - Clara: 8 PP → 40 EC  
   - Dan: 4 PP → 20 EC  

3. **Salaries & Tech Maintenance**  
   - Anna: 40 EC (Env. Advisor) + (New Carbon Capture not active yet, or if so, it’s 20 EC maintenance next turn).  
   - Ben: 50 Eng + 15 automation = 65.  
   - Clara: 30 Tech + 15 recycling unit (starts next round? If it starts now, she pays 15). Let’s assume it starts next round.  
   - Dan: 30 for Technician.

4. **Operations & New Builds**  
   - Anna: 20 (Logging) + 30 (Bioplastics) + 250 for carbon capture? She paid that in Phase 2.  
   - Ben: 35 (Urban op).  
   - Clara: 40 (Mine op) + 200 for the recycling unit.  
   - Dan: 25 + 25 = 50 (two farms), plus no new factory cost this round, just the hire of a Tech next round’s salary.

5. **Sales**  
   - Anna: Might sell 1 or 2 Bioplastics at 50 EC each if she produced them. Let’s say she sells 2 for 100 total. Also might have leftover Timber.  
   - Ben: Produces 3 goods, sells 2 at 50 each = 100 EC, keeps 1.  
   - Clara: Possibly sells 2 Minerals to the bank for 80 total if she wants capital.  
   - Dan: Has 6 Agriculture total. Sells 4 at 25 each = 100 EC, keeps 2 for Anna’s trade (which took place at 80 EC total).  

#### Net Capital Tally

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 480  
  - Outflow (Production): 20 + 30 = 50 for operations, 25 carbon tax, 40 Env. Advisor = 115.  
  - Outflow (Purchase): 250 for Carbon Capture.  
  - Income (Sales): ~100 from Bioplastics.  
  - Income (Trade): -80 to buy Agriculture from Dan.  
  - Net = 480 - (115 + 250 + 80) + 100 = 480 - 445 + 100 = 135  
  - End: **135 EC**, Pollution = **5**  

- **Ben**  
  - Start: 210  
  - Outflow: 35 (op) + 30 (tax) + 65 (salary + maintenance) = 130  
  - Income: 100 from goods sold.  
  - Net = 210 - 130 + 100 = 180  
  - End: **180 EC**, Pollution = **6**  

- **Clara**  
  - Start: 510  
  - Outflow: 40 (op) + 40 (tax) + 30 (salary) + 200 (recycling unit) = 310  
  - Income: Let’s say she sells 2 minerals for 80 to the bank.  
  - Net = 510 - 310 + 80 = 280  
  - End: **280 EC**, Pollution = **8**  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 705  
  - Outflow: 50 (ops for 2 farms) + 20 (tax) + 30 (new Tech salary) = 100  
  - Income: 100 (selling 4 produce) + 80 from Anna’s purchase of 2 produce = 180  
  - Net = +80  
  - End: 705 + 80 = **785 EC**, Pollution = **4**  

**Key Moments**:
- Anna invests heavily in eco-tech but drains capital drastically.  
- Dan leaps ahead in capital with efficient, moderate-pollution farming.  
- Clara tries to offset pollution next round with recycling.  
- Ben remains mid-range in capital, consistent moderate pollution.

**Time (Round 3)**: ~10 minutes.

---

## 6. ROUND 4

**Time Estimate**: ~10 minutes

### Phase 1: Production

- **Anna**  
  - Logging Camp: 3 PP if no Advisor. Bioplastics: 5 PP base.  
  - Now **Carbon Capture System** is active on Bioplastics: -6 PP. If the Env. Advisor is also assigned, that’s a total of -9, but PP can’t go below 0 for that factory. So it becomes 0 PP.  
  - Logging Camp 3 PP, no Advisor.  
  - Total = 3 PP. Production: +2 Timber from Logging, +2 Bioplastics from the plant (using 2 Timber or the Agriculture purchased from Dan).  

- **Ben**  
  - Urban Plant w/Automation: 35 EC op. +3 Manufactured Goods again if input is available. He still has 1 leftover mineral, might buy more if needed. Let’s say 3 goods. 6 PP.  

- **Clara**  
  - Mine & Smelter w/Recycling Unit (active now): Base 8 PP, -3 from recycling = 5 PP total. 40 EC op, plus 15 maintenance. +2 minerals.  

- **Dan**  
  - 2 Farms: Each 25 EC → 50 total. +3 produce each → total 6 Agriculture. 2 PP each tile = 4 PP combined, but with the Technician, no direct pollution drop, just ensuring maximum yield.  

### Phase 2: Construction & Technology

- **Anna**: No capital to expand further (only 135 EC).  
- **Ben**: Buys a second **Urban Manufacturing Plant** on his Plains tile (house-ruled if you can build Urban on Plains if it’s a multi-purpose tile—but typically we need Urban terrain. Let’s say he chooses a *Small Recycling Center* instead for 200 EC, but he only has 180 EC—he’s short. So he waits.  
- **Clara**: No new builds. She’s saving for a potential big play next round.  
- **Dan**: Considers a **Vertical Integration Logistics** Tech (300 EC, not currently revealed?), but not in the original list. Let’s assume he can’t buy that. He does nothing major.

### Phase 3: Trade & Negotiation

- **Anna** might trade away some Bioplastics to Ben for 60 EC each if the two sides agree, or sell them to the bank at 50 EC.  
- **Ben** is short on raw materials, contemplates buying 1 Agriculture from Dan for 25 EC so he can keep producing full capacity next round. They arrange a small deal if they want.  
- **Clara** sells 2 minerals to the bank for 80 EC if no better deal arises.  
- **Dan** sells leftover agriculture to Anna or the bank. Possibly sells 2 to Anna for 40 each again.

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Pollution

1. **Pollution**  
   - Anna: 3 PP total → 15 EC tax.  
   - Ben: 6 PP → 30 EC tax.  
   - Clara: 5 PP → 25 EC tax.  
   - Dan: 4 PP → 20 EC tax.

2. **Salaries & Maintenance**  
   - Anna: 40 Env. Advisor + 20 for carbon capture.  
   - Ben: 50 Eng + 15 automation.  
   - Clara: 30 Tech + 15 recycling.  
   - Dan: 30 Tech.

3. **Operation Costs**  
   - Anna: 20 (logging) + 30 (bioplastics).  
   - Ben: 35 (urban).  
   - Clara: 40 (mine).  
   - Dan: 50 (two farms).

4. **Sales**  
   - Anna: Sells 2 Bioplastics at 50 each = 100 EC.  
   - Ben: Sells 3 goods at 50 each = 150 EC.  
   - Clara: Sells 2 minerals for 80 if she chooses.  
   - Dan: Possibly sells 5 agriculture for 125 if the rate is 25 each.  

#### End-of-Round Capital Calculation

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 135  
  - Outflow: 15 (tax) + 40 (Env) + 20 (carbon capture) + 20 + 30 (ops) = 125 total.  
  - Inflow: 100 from Bioplastics.  
  - Net = 135 - 125 + 100 = 110  
  - End: **110 EC**, PP = **3**  

- **Ben**  
  - Start: 180  
  - Outflow: 30 (tax) + 50 (Eng) + 15 (automation) + 35 (op) = 130  
  - Inflow: 150 from selling goods.  
  - Net = 180 - 130 + 150 = 200  
  - End: **200 EC**, PP = **6**  

- **Clara**  
  - Start: 280  
  - Outflow: 25 (tax) + 30 (Tech) + 15 (recycling) + 40 (op) = 110  
  - Inflow: Let’s say 80 from minerals.  
  - Net = 280 - 110 + 80 = 250  
  - End: **250 EC**, PP = **5**  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 785  
  - Outflow: 20 (tax) + 30 (Tech) + 50 (farm ops) = 100  
  - Inflow: ~125 from produce sold if he sells 5 out of 6.  
  - Net = +25  
  - End: 785 + 25 = **810 EC**, PP = **4**  

**Key Moment**: Anna’s Carbon Capture drastically lowers her pollution. Dan leads in capital with consistent farming.  

**Time (Round 4)**: ~10 minutes.

---

## 7. ROUND 5

**Time Estimate**: ~10 minutes

### Phase 1: Production

- **Anna**  
  - Logging Camp (3 PP) + Bioplastics with Carbon Capture (0 PP). Total 3 PP.  
  - Gains +2 Timber, +2 Bioplastics.  

- **Ben**  
  - Urban Plant with automation: +3 goods, 6 PP.  

- **Clara**  
  - Mine & Smelter with recycling: 5 PP total. +2 minerals.  

- **Dan**  
  - 2 Farms: 4 PP, +6 Agriculture. Technician ensures max yield.

### Phase 2: Construction & Technology

- **Anna**: No major expansions (110 EC left).  
- **Ben**: Buys a **Small Recycling Center** for 200 EC if possible—but he has exactly 200 EC, so it’d drop him to 0. He decides to do it to reduce future pollution.  
- **Clara**: Considering a second factory on her Forest tile. Perhaps a **Timber Logging Camp** for 150 EC. She invests 150 to build it.  
- **Dan**: Sits comfortably, might buy a **Solar-Wind Hybrid Array** if it were revealed, but it’s not from the initial list. He does nothing.

### Phase 3: Trade & Negotiation

- Anna & Dan keep small trades for biomass.  
- Clara might buy 1 Agriculture from Dan for 25 EC if she plans to do something with it next round, but no strong synergy right now. Possibly no trade.  
- Ben invests in the recycling center, so no extra deals.

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Pollution

1. **Pollution**  
   - Anna: 3 PP → 15 EC tax.  
   - Ben: 6 PP from plant → 30 EC tax. The new Recycling Center starts next round.  
   - Clara: 5 PP from mine. The new Logging Camp won’t operate until next round, so no extra pollution yet.  
   - Dan: 4 PP from 2 farms → 20 EC tax.

2. **Salaries & Maintenance**  
   - Anna: 40 (Env. Advisor) + 20 (Capture).  
   - Ben: 50 (Eng) + 15 (automation) + new Recycling Center cost 200 (construction) and 20 if it has maintenance. (If the center is standard 200 EC, 20 op cost next round, 4 PP pollution possibly next round).  
   - Clara: 30 (Tech) + 15 (recycling) + 150 new Logging Camp.  
   - Dan: 30 (Tech).

3. **Operation Costs**  
   - Anna: 20 (Logging) + 30 (Bioplastics).  
   - Ben: 35 (Urban).  
   - Clara: 40 (Mine).  
   - Dan: 50 (two farms).

4. **Sales**  
   - Anna: Sells 2 Bioplastics for 100 total.  
   - Ben: Sells 3 goods for 150.  
   - Clara: Sells 2 minerals for 80 if desired.  
   - Dan: Sells 5 Agriculture for 125, keeps 1 for any trade.

#### Net Capital Tally

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 110  
  - Outflow: 15 (tax) + 40 (advisor) + 20 (capture) + 20 (logging) + 30 (bioplastics) = 125  
  - Income: 100 from Bioplastics  
  - Net = 110 - 125 + 100 = 85  
  - End: **85 EC**, PP = **3**  

- **Ben**  
  - Start: 200  
  - Outflow: 30 (tax) + 50 (eng) + 15 (automation) + 35 (op) + 200 (new recycling center) = 330  
  - Income: 150 from goods  
  - Net = 200 - 330 + 150 = 20  
  - End: **20 EC**, PP = **6**  

- **Clara**  
  - Start: 250  
  - Outflow: 25 (tax) + 30 (tech) + 15 (recycling) + 40 (mine op) + 150 (new logging camp) = 260  
  - Income: 80 from minerals  
  - Net = 250 - 260 + 80 = 70  
  - End: **70 EC**, PP = **5**  

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 810  
  - Outflow: 20 (tax) + 30 (tech) + 50 (farms) = 100  
  - Income: 125 from produce  
  - Net = +25  
  - End: 810 + 25 = **835 EC**, PP = **4**  

**Key Moment**: Ben invests nearly everything in a Recycling Center to reduce future pollution. Dan is far ahead in capital, while Anna focuses on near-zero pollution.

**Time (Round 5)**: ~10 minutes.

---

## 8. ROUND 6 & FINAL SCORING

This is typically the **final round** (the group decided a 6-round cap). 

**Time Estimate**: ~10 minutes

### Phase 1: Production

- **Anna**  
  - Logging Camp: 3 PP, Bioplastics w/Carbon Capture: effectively 0 PP. Total 3 PP.  
  - Gains +2 Timber, +2 Bioplastics.  

- **Ben**  
  - Urban Plant (6 PP) + new Recycling Center (4 PP base?). If he operates both: total 10 PP. However, the Recycling Center can reduce net pollution by 3 if it recycles waste. Let’s say net 7 PP.  

- **Clara**  
  - Mine (5 PP with recycling) + new Logging Camp (3 PP). If both run, total 8 PP.  

- **Dan**  
  - 2 Farms: 4 PP, +6 Agriculture.

### Phase 2: Construction & Tech

Most players skip major builds to save final capital.

### Phase 3: Trade & Negotiation

- Minimal trades—everyone tries to finalize production or hold capital.

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Pollution

1. **Pollution**  
   - Anna: 3 PP → 15 EC tax.  
   - Ben: 7 PP → 35 EC tax.  
   - Clara: 8 PP → 40 EC tax.  
   - Dan: 4 PP → 20 EC tax.

2. **Salaries & Maintenance**  
   - Anna: 40 (Advisor) + 20 (capture) + ops (20 + 30) = 110 total ignoring the carbon tax.  
   - Ben: 50 Eng + 15 Automation + ops (35 + ~20 Recycling?) = 120 ignoring carbon tax.  
   - Clara: 30 Tech + 15 recycling + ops (40 for mine + 20 logging) = 105 ignoring carbon tax.  
   - Dan: 30 Tech + 50 ops = 80 ignoring carbon tax.

3. **Sales**  
   - Anna: Sells 2 Bioplastics for 100.  
   - Ben: Maybe 3 Manufactured Goods for 150, plus the Recycling Center might net +5 EC from waste recycling if that’s the rule.  
   - Clara: 2 minerals for 80, plus up to 2 Timber for 40 each? Possibly 1 or 2 if the logging camp is fully operational.  
   - Dan: Sells 5 Agriculture for 125 again.

#### Final Capital Calculation

- **Anna**  
  - Start: 85  
  - Outflow: 15 (tax) + 110 (ops+salary+maintenance) = 125  
  - Income: 100 from Bioplastics  
  - Net = 85 - 125 + 100 = 60  
  - Final: **60 EC**, Final PP = **3**

- **Ben**  
  - Start: 20  
  - Outflow: 35 (tax) + 120 (ops+salary+maintenance) = 155  
  - Income: 150 from goods + 5 from recycling? = 155 total  
  - Net = 20 - 155 + 155 = 20  
  - Final: **20 EC**, Final PP = **7**  

*(He had 7 net PP, we used 7 × 5 = 35 tax. The recycling 3 PP reduction from 10 to 7 was accounted for above.)*

- **Clara**  
  - Start: 70  
  - Outflow: 40 (tax) + 105 (mine/tech/logging) = 145  
  - Income: 80 (minerals) + 40 (1 or 2 timber sold? Let’s assume 2 logs at 40 total) = 120  
  - Net = 70 - 145 + 120 = 45  
  - Final: **45 EC**, Final PP = **8**

- **Dan**  
  - Start: 835  
  - Outflow: 20 (tax) + 80 (ops+salary) = 100  
  - Income: 125 (produce)  
  - Net = +25  
  - Final: 835 + 25 = **860 EC**, Final PP = **4**

### 8.1 Victory Condition

Compute **Capital ÷ (1 + Pollution)**:

1. **Anna**:  
   - Capital = 60  
   - Pollution = 3  
   - Ratio = 60 ÷ (1+3) = 60/4 = **15.0**  

2. **Ben**:  
   - Capital = 20  
   - Pollution = 7  
   - Ratio = 20 ÷ (1+7) = 20/8 = **2.5**  

3. **Clara**:  
   - Capital = 45  
   - Pollution = 8  
   - Ratio = 45 ÷ (1+8) = 45/9 = **5.0**  

4. **Dan**:  
   - Capital = 860  
   - Pollution = 4  
   - Ratio = 860 ÷ (1+4) = 860/5 = **172.0**  

**Dan** wins overwhelmingly, leveraging efficient, moderately low-pollution farming to amass capital. **Anna** places second with a ratio of 15.0, then **Clara** at 5.0, and finally **Ben** at 2.5.

## 9. POST-GAME DISCUSSION

1. **Game Length & Timing**  
   - 6 rounds in ~1 hour to 1.25 hours. Fairly smooth with only a few negotiations.  

2. **Rule Observations**  
   - No major confusion. The single pollution track and simplified resource categories kept bookkeeping minimal.  

3. **Strategy Insights**  
   - **Dan**’s minimal pollution strategy, plus large-scale farming, was extremely profitable.  
   - **Anna** balanced low pollution but didn’t produce enough revenue.  
   - **Ben** overspent on technologies and expansions without enough resource input synergy.  
   - **Clara** stuck to heavy mining but faced high carbon taxes.  

4. **Potential Tweaks**  
   - Possibly buffing high-tech manufacturing returns or better synergy for Resource Tycoons to catch up.  
   - Ensuring partial input logic for factories is clarified.  

The game ends with **Dan** as the clear winner. The revised design proved to be a smoother, faster experience while still highlighting the tension between economic gain and environmental cost.
